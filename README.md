# Gravity-Simulation-using-Turtle-Python
This repository contains a Python script for simulating a simple gravitational system using Turtle graphics. The simulation includes a sun, planets, and a moon, all interacting under gravitational forces. The particles are represented as custom-shaped turtles that move according to Newtonian mechanics.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Turtle module (included with standard Python distribution)
Features
Custom Shapes:

Create custom shapes for planets and stars with bright and dark sides.
Gravitational System:

Simulates gravitational interactions between celestial bodies.
Bodies move according to gravitational forces and initial velocities.
Real-time Visualization:

Animates the movement of celestial bodies in real-time.
Adjustable frame rate for smooth simulation.
